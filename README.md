# SRFLP-BB
This is a C implementation of a parallel branch-and-bound solver for the single-row facility layout problem using semidefinite programming bounds.

The solver is exact and always finds the optimal solution when terminating. Moreover, the branch-and-bound implementation is parallelized using POSIX Threads.

This code builds upon the _BiqCrunch_ solver available at https://biqcrunch.lipn.univ-paris13.fr/Download. Moreover, the limited-memory quasi Newton code _L-BFGS-B_ https://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgsb.html is used.

## The Single-Row Facility Layout Problem
Given $n$ one-dimensional facilities with positive integer lenghts $\ell_i$ and integer weights $c_{ij}$ for all pairs of facilities, we want to arrange all $n$ facilities on a straight line such that the total weighted sum of center-to-center distances between all pairs of facilities is minimized. Note that any such arrangement can be represented by a permutation $\pi \in \Pi_n$. Thus, the goal is to solve the problem
```math
\displaystyle \min_{\pi \in \Pi_n} \sum c_{ij} d_{ij}^\pi,
```
where $d_{ij}^\pi$ denotes the center-to-center distance of $i$ and $j$ with respect to the permutation $\pi$.

## SDP-based Bounds
The solver uses semidefinite programming (SDP) based bounds within the branch-and-bound approach. Check out my master's thesis https://jan-schwiddessen.com/assets/pdfs/master_thesis.pdf and the references therein. However, note that this repository does not contain the code to produce the results in the master's thesis. It will be published soon.

## Instances
See https://www.philipphungerlaender.com/benchmark-libraries/layout-lib/row-layout-instances/ for the instance format and to download many instances used in the literature.

## Installation

An installation of the IntelÂ® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) is required. After correctly setting (the environment variable) MKLROOT, simply type:

```
mkdir obj
make
```

## Example
To solve an instance, do the following:
```
cd bin/
./srflp_bb example_15.txt
```
Here, "example_15.txt" is a text file that encodes the instance to be solved. The output will look similar to this:
```
Instance name: example_15.txt
